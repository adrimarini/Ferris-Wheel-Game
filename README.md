<h4>In this game you will be asked to duplicate a light pattern shown on the Santa
Monica Ferris Wheel. Get it right and you move forward to a new round with more arms to remember!<h4>

<h2>/// Here are the rules :</h2>
<p>  Step 1: CHOSE A SPEED.
      <li> The wheel will begin in motion, for newbees, PAUSE the wheel, press start, and see what level you can get to! If your feeling confident, click PLAY to set the wheel back in motion, click start, and get ready for a challenge.
      <br>
 Step 2: GAME OVER <br>
      <li> If you select the wrong arm, the game will alert you with a game over
      message and let you know what level you made it to
      <br>
 Step 3: PLAY ANOTHER ROUND <br>
      <li> To play another round, refresh the page, decide if you want your wheel
      in motion or paused, then click the start button
      <br>
Good Luck

<h2>/// Technologies Used: </h2>
  <p>This game was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery. The animation of the wheel was done using a framework called TweenLite made by GreenStock. A more advanced example of the ferris wheel animation used in the game can be found at:
  https://codepen.io/GreenSock/pen/wBbKs/.</p>

  <h2>/// Approach Taken </h2>

  <p>I created this game by first generating the wheel with Tweenlite, then added in game logic using vanilla Javascript and jQuery.</p>

  <h2>/// Unsolved Problems <h2>

  <h4>Some next steps I would like to take are to:</h4>
  <p>
    <li>create baskets for the Ferris Wheel,  and work on making the interface look better/ more like a real ferris wheel
    <li>prevent the wheel from starting in motion right away
    <li>make the game refresh itself once a player loses
    <li>fix the start button and deactivate it once the player begins a game
    <li>change the 'Game over' alert to something more user friendly
    <li>add level buttons that change the speed the wheel turns based on the level (the higher the level, the faster it will spin)
